# Code Challenge 2
### 1st Process
1. Forked code challenge 2 from [Instruction Page](https://github.com/msimbo/code-challenge-2), which creates a copy of the code challenge 2 Repository (Repo) into my own Github account. 
2. Cloned code challenge 2 to my directory **msimbo-coding** by using command **git clone http://**
3. Searched online for **Vector Logos & Icons** 
4. I added additional **logos & icons** to my *Directory*
5. Made sure all is in sync with github
   #### Example:
    * git status 
    * git add 
    * git commit "commit message"
    * git push

### 2nd Process
1. Opened project **Code Challenge 2** in **VSCODE** using commandline
   #### Example:
   * Type: **code** *(Make sure your in the projects directory)*

2. After opening the inex.html file I noticed Dele (The Professor) had begun the initial layout, as well as the styles.css file.
3. I began the replecation of the Google.com homepage

### Index.html modification

1. Replicated the boxes needed for the Google.com homepage layout.
2. Created the necessary **Div Containers** 
   ### Example:
   * Main
   * Searcg Bar
   * Footer
   * Left
   * Right
3. During the index.html modification I would also modify the styles.css file as well, by adding the proper categories (ids and values) which are directly tied into the div's I created on the index.html file.
   ### Example:
   * images1
   * images2
   * main
   * input types (Text and submit)
   * footer
   * etc.

4. Occasionally, I would also update the readme.md file as well.
5. This project was very challenging, I had to research online on how to properly create the Google.com search bar, either exact or as close as I could. I would also utilize the reading we did in Project-2.
6. I enjoyed this challenege, looking forward to the up and coming weeks.
